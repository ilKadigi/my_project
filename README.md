My project for The Data Incubator 

Hello TDI team, this is my project I wish to do during the fellowship.

My project will involve doveloping a Stochastic Simulation Model (SSM) for forecasting food crop production in Tanzania. Food production in Tanzania is performed under high risks and uncertainties due to overdependence on rain-fed farming systems. This practice has caused occasional food insecurity to the majority of the impoverished population. Realizing the volatility nature of the production system in Tanzania, this project demonstrates the procedures to include risks and uncertainties in forecasting and economic feasibility analyses of food crops
